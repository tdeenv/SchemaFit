# SchemaFit
A locally run fitness tracker that uses Python and SQLite to log and track workouts, including exercises, sets, and body measurements. 

The history page shows all the saved workouts, as well as a chart tracking body measurements over time, and a chart tracking estimated 1 Rep Maximum for each exercise over time. This is based on the Epley Formula. 

It is also designed to be packaged into an .exe using Pyinstaller.
